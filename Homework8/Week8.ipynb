    "\n",
    "Take the following code for the Adams BM method and clean it up. At each stage, rerun and make sure the output looks fine. Here's an optional suggested procedure:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Fix the formatting (4 space indent, no `;` in lines, proper spacing around variables, etc) - try an online code cleanup tool if you want, like <https://www.tutorialspoint.com/online_python_formatter.htm> to clean up spacing (though be careful; that tool will remove the necessary parenthesis around the print function contents.) There are places it adds a bit too much space, like `[:n + 1]`, but it's a good start.\n",
    "* Drop unneeded characters, like the `.` or `.0` after values (unless you explicitly want an float, such as in a definition), or the `0,` in a `range(0, x)`, or parenthesis around return statements.\n",
    "* Replace the `%` formatting with an f-string or `.format(...)`\n",
    "* Replace the lists with numpy arrays, and use the correct length instead of 500. This should allow you to clean up several uses of `t`, `y`, and `yy`, and replace the list comprehension of `ysol` with a numpy expression.\n",
    "* Drop as many loops as you can; though several loops may not be able to be removed. You can at least factor out the `t` calculation and make that a simple numpy expression involving `linspace` or `arange` near the beginning of the function.\n",
    "* Move the globals (`t`, `y`, `yy`) into the proper functions. You might want to restart the kernel before rerunning after this step just to make sure the global variables are gone. And the global `yy` is actually unused. You can also move `n`, `A`, and `B` into the function call at the end, rather than defining them at the top. You can use `len(t)` instead of `n` in the print loop.\n",
    "* Clean up `rk4`. The parameter `t` is unused in the `rk4` function; it's immediately replaced. You can either only modify `y`, or return `y` instead of doing both (which is really confusing). It also does not need to loop; it's really only being used to calculate one value at a time. You could pass in `t[0], y[0]` and get `y[1]` back, then repeat.\n",
    "* Use `n` instead of a hard-coded 24 in `h2`\n",
    "* Replace `F0`, `F1`, `F2`, `F3` with an array. You can then \"roll\" the array with a one line expression each time instead of the manual roll that is done. Note that `f` accepts array arguments, so the initial `F` calculation is expressible in one line as long as you compute `F[4]` and then replace it later before using it.\n",
    "* See if any lines are better moved/rearranged.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will expect most of the cleanups to be completed; though you can take a different path or do several of them different ways; just make sure it is similar in legibility. I will not require every point to be done."
